# CS50 CodeQuest 🚀

Welcome to my coding quest through Harvard's CS50 courses! I'm tackling **CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x)** and **CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (CS50W)**. This repo houses my notes, code, projects, and execution guides. Ultimate goal: Master programming from basics to full-stack web apps.

## Progress Overview

### CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (CS50W)
Focus: Building dynamic web apps using Python, Django, SQL, JavaScript, and more. Overall: **Incomplete** (Completed: Weeks 1-4).

| Section | Title | Status | Key Objectives |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Introduction | Completed | Understand web app architecture, HTTP, and development workflow. Set up environment and explore Flask basics. |
| 2 | HTML, CSS | Completed | Master semantic HTML5, responsive CSS (Flexbox/Grid), and styling for modern UIs. Build static pages. |
| 3 | Git | Completed | Learn version control with Git: branching, merging, and collaborating on code. |
| 4 | Python | Completed | Dive into Python syntax, functions, OOP, and libraries. Solve problems algorithmically. |
| 5 | Django | Incomplete | Build web apps with Django: views, templates, and URL routing. Handle forms and user input. |
| 6 | SQL, Models, and Migrations | Incomplete | Design databases with SQL; use Django ORM for models, queries, and migrations. Ensure data integrity. |
| 7 | JavaScript | Incomplete | Core JS: variables, functions, DOM manipulation, events, and async programming (Promises/Fetch). |
| 8 | User Interfaces | Incomplete | Create interactive UIs with JS frameworks; focus on UX principles and responsive design. |
| 9 | Testing, CI/CD | Incomplete | Write unit/integration tests; set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and quality assurance. |
| 10 | Scalability and Security | Incomplete | Optimize apps for scale (caching, load balancing); implement security best practices (auth, encryption). |

### CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x)
Focus: From zero to hero in CS – algorithms, data structures, and languages like C, Python, SQL. Overall: **Incomplete** (Completed: Week 0).

| Week | Title | Status | Key Objectives |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 0 | Scratch | Completed | Introduce computational thinking via visual programming. Design simple games/animations to grasp loops, conditionals, events. |
| 1 | C | Incomplete | Learn low-level programming in C: variables, functions, loops, conditionals. Compile and debug code. |
| 2 | Arrays | Incomplete | Understand memory, pointers, strings, and arrays. Process data efficiently in C. |
| 3 | Algorithms | Incomplete | Implement sorting/searching algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Linear/Binary Search). Analyze time complexity (Big O). |
| 4 | Memory | Incomplete | Explore dynamic memory (malloc/free), buffers, and common errors like segmentation faults. |
| 5 | Data Structures | Incomplete | Build linked lists, hash tables, tries. Understand trade-offs in storage/retrieval. |
| 6 | Python | Incomplete | Transition to high-level Python: file I/O, exceptions, libraries. Compare with C. |
| 7 | SQL | Incomplete | Query relational databases: SELECT, JOINs, indexes. Design schemas for real-world data. |
| 8 | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Incomplete | Build web pages: HTML structure, CSS styling, basic JS interactivity. |
| 9 | Flask | Incomplete | Develop full-stack apps with Flask: routes, templates (Jinja), sessions. |
| 10 | The End (Final Project) | Incomplete | Apply all concepts to a capstone project. Present and reflect on learning. |

**Projects**: [Pset 0: Scratch](link-to-your-project) | [Pset 1: Mario](link-to-your-project) | ... (Add your links and code here!)

## Goals & Milestones
- **Short-term**: Complete Django and SQL in CS50W; tackle Week 1-3 in CS50x.
- **Long-term**: Finish both courses, deploy a full web app, contribute to open-source.
- **Resources**:

## نحوه اجرای برنامه‌ها (How to Run Projects)
این بخش راهنمایی گام‌به‌گام برای اجرای پروژه‌های مختلف در repo رو داره. اول repo رو کلون کن، بعد بسته به نوع پروژه (Python, Django, Flask, یا C) عمل کن. فرض می‌کنم Python 3+ و Git نصب داری (اگر نه، از [python.org](https://python.org) و [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) دانلود کن).
